    <description>
    * Almost bare metal HTTP/HTTPS server. 
    * Intends to keep a low memory profile and CPU loads.
    * Provide ergonomical calling but these are optional to static typed calls.
    * Drops rigorous compliance with legacy issues. Focuses on recent standards and newer browsers.
    * Designed with the concept of providing as low of latency as possible for responses while still being asynchronous.
    * Is oriented entirely for asynchronous code with one or multiple parallel threads.
    * Code base is kept simple, easy to read, and easy to modify.
