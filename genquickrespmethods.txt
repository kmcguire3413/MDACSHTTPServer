* CGI header field specifying the status of the HTTP response. Normal HTTP responses use a separate "Status-Line" instead, defined by RFC 7230.
Status
* Tells a server which (presumably in the middle of a HTTP -> HTTPS migration) hosts mixed content that the client would prefer redirection to HTTPS and can handle Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests. _Must not be used with HTTP/2_.
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests
* Provide the duration of the audio or video in seconds; only supported by Gecko browsers

X-Content-Type-Options
* Specifies the technology (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP, JBoss) supporting the web application (version details are often in X-Runtime, X-Version, or X-AspNet-Version)
X-Powered-By
* Correlates HTTP requests between a client and server.
X-Request-ID
* Correlates HTTP requests between a client and server.
X-Correlation-ID
* Recommends the preferred rendering engine (often a backward-compatibility mode) to use to display the content. Also used to activate Chrome Frame in Internet Explorer.
X-UA-Compatible
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter.
